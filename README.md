# vue-cli-plugin-tabs

For degenerates like me that use tab indentation. Invoke after creating a new vue-cli project to turn 2-space indents into tabs for all generated files.

## Usage

```bash
vue add @ky-is/tabs
```

Note: Due to the custom way vue-cli generates `package.json`, its indentation will not be converted, so you'll need to manually edit this file (per https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/2072).
